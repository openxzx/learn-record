    "# Python spam\n",
    "\n",
    "    Spam is a piece of Python software built upon NumPy and SciPy for the analysis and manipulation of 3D and 2D data sets in material science, be they from x-ray tomography, random fields or any other source.\n",
    "\n",
    "    A number of common functions are provided that are either lacking or slow in Numpy and Scipy, which are expected to be used by users within new python scripts. These functions are in the tools/ directory, and include tools to work with random fields, morphological operations, digital image correlation, and labelled images. Some of spam’s functions transparently call C/C++ functions for speed.\n",
    "\n",
    "    Some user-callable scipts are also provided – they are more complex pieces of code that combine a number of functions and which have a command-line interface. For the moment the clients are 3 different image correlation techniques."
